Delivering a project to attend a challenge made by DIO IoT develper course

The project must attend these requests:

Design a project to monitore a stand with some plants which using a temperature sensor, a fan motor, a LED and a buzzer:

(a) Perform the temperature reading;

(b) Turn on the fan when the temperature is equal or greater than 30°C;

(c) If the temperature is over than 50°C turn on the LED and the buzzer.

(d) All the process must be designed to be viable using an Arduino board.
